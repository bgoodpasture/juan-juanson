Explain the relationship between .new() and def initialize().
def initialize is a special method that runs whenever you type .new and it creates a new instance.

Define class, subclass, instance, and self.
class = animal (bear)
subclass = types of animals (herbivore, omnivore)
instance = creation of 1 animal (brown bear)
self = refers to the specifics to the instance of an Animal/class

Properly define instance and class variables.
instance is the creation of a class and the variables are what

describe the instantiation.
is the unique creation of a class using the .new method.

Properly define instance and class methods.
A class method pertains to the containing class, while an instance method pertains to the instance of that class.


Distinguish whether a piece of data is best suited to being stored in a local, instance, or class variable.
class variables data is applied to the class so all instantiations must have these variables.

instance variables apply to every instance and will be there as long as the instance exists.

local variables pertain to only one instance and do not exist outside of that instance.

Describe the relationship of attr_ and “getter” and “setter” methods.
attr_ is a shortcut to define the properties of an object.
getter gets the value of a property
setter sets the value of a property

Distinguish whether a piece of data is best suited to having its accessibility defined by attr_reader, attr_writer, attr_accessor or none of the above.

attr_reader,  allows you to only read the value of the property
attr_writer,  allows you to only write the value of the property
attr_accessor, allows you to both read and write the properties value
